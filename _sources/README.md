# bash-zsh
This project is meant to compare two shell scripting langugaes, bash and zsh. Both languages are compared based on their
- Commands
- Performance
- Configuration Files
- Prompt
- Completion
- Scripting differences

This comparison helps to determine which scripting language should be chosen, depending on the operating system and task requirements. Note that the performance was done on macOS and so to find your despired shell on other operating systems you need to do your performance tests (instructions provided).
