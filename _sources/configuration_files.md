# Configuration Files
Bash and zsh work on different configuration files. In non-login interactive shells, bash reads .bashrc file, and in login shells, it reads .bash_profile. On the other hand, zsh reads .zshrc in an interactive shell and .profile in a login shell.

An interactive shell is a simple shell that accepts user input and returns the desired output while when we log into a session, the first process that runs under our user ID is a login shell.

Since the zsh is a shell built on the top of bash we may say that both are very similar. Moreover, zsh contains all the features from bash and provides a few more. Zsh gives you more plugins and themes and if you truly interested in them you can look at https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/iTerm/zsh.html
